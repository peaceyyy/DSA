### Problem Kernel

Given three membership sets (Regular, Premium, VIP) with 10 gaming stations, implement set operations to answer Maya's operational queries about station occupancy patterns.

### 15-Minute Sprint Analysis & Review

#### ‚úÖ **What You Did Well:**

**Problem Decomposition (Excellent):**

- Correctly identified this as a **bit vector/set operations** problem
- Recognized the need for intersection (`&&`), union (`||`), and complement (`!`) operations
- Successfully mapped story requirements to DSA operations:
  - "Both Regular AND Premium" ‚Üí intersection
  - "Regular but NOT VIP" ‚Üí set difference
  - "Any member type" ‚Üí union of three sets

**Code Organization:**

- Functions follow single responsibility principle
- Clear variable naming (`busyStations`, `forUpgrades`, `allStations`)
- Proper function signatures matching the problem requirements

#### üîç **Areas for Improvement:**

**Critical Logic Issues (2 functions need attention):**

1. **`getPromotionStations()`** - Initialization bug:

   ```c
   // Current: Uninitialized memory access
   (*noPremium)[i] = !(noPremium[i]); // Reading uninitialized data!

   // Should be: Direct complement
   (*noPremium)[i] = !(premium[i]);
   ```
2. **`checkServiceConsistency()`** - Inverted logic:

   ```c
   // Current: Returns TRUE when inconsistent (backwards!)
   if (premium[i] == 0) isConsistentService = TRUE;

   // Logic: Should return FALSE when VIP exists but no Premium
   ```

**Attention to Detail:**

- **Initial misunderstanding**: Thought "each SET was the station" vs "each INDEX was the station"
- **Reading comprehension**: Story problems require careful parsing of constraints vs narrative

#### üìà **Pattern Recognition Success:**

- Identified **subset checking** pattern in consistency function
- Recognized **set complement** in promotion stations
- Correctly applied **intersection** and **set difference** operations
- Strong intuition for translating English queries into logical expressions

#### üéØ **Key Learning:**

**Story ‚Üí DSA Translation Skills**: Your 15-minute sprint showed excellent pattern recognition but highlighted the need for **more careful constraint parsing**. The confusion about "stations as indices vs sets" is a common translation pitfall.

### Pseudocode Patterns Mastered:

```
// Intersection: A AND B
for i in range: result[i] = setA[i] && setB[i]

// Set Difference: A - B (A but not B)  
for i in range: result[i] = setA[i] && !setB[i]

// Union: A OR B OR C
for i in range: result[i] = setA[i] || setB[i] || setC[i]

// Subset Check: A ‚äÜ B (all A elements also in B)
for i in range: if A[i] && !B[i] return FALSE
return TRUE
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time**: O(n) for all operations where n = MAX_STATIONS (10)
- **Space**: O(n) for result allocation in set operations

### Reflection Question:

How might you develop a systematic approach to distinguish between **narrative elements** and **actual constraints** when parsing story problems under time pressure?
